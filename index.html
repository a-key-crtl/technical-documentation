                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. 
                    Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment 
                    to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements 
                    such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by 
                    supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
                        For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, 
                        form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side 
                        extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, 
                        or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>
